# Design & Analysis of Algorithms

Welcome to the **Design & Analysis of Algorithms** repository! This repository contains various algorithms, their design techniques, and analyses for performance optimization. Whether you're a student or developer, you'll find useful examples and explanations for understanding and implementing key algorithms in computer science.

## 📚 About

The purpose of this repository is to showcase various **algorithm design paradigms** and their applications in solving computational problems efficiently. Here, you'll find algorithms that span classic topics such as sorting, searching, graph traversal, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and much more. So if you are a student you can easily revise DAA for semester exams with code implementation and this was somewhat my main reason for making it. Each algorithm is accompanied by detailed explanations, time and space complexity analysis, and sample implementations in various programming languages.

## 🛠️ Algorithm Design Paradigms

This repository covers the following algorithm design strategies:

- **Divide and Conquer**  
  Breaking down a problem into smaller subproblems, solving them independently, and combining the results.  
  Examples: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Binary Search.

- **Dynamic Programming**  
  Solving problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing the results to avoid redundant calculations.  
  Examples: Fibonacci Sequence, Knapsack Problem, Longest Common Subsequence.

- **Greedy Algorithms**  
  Making locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum.  
  Examples: Dijkstra’s Algorithm, Kruskal’s Algorithm, Activity Selection.

- **Backtracking**  
  Trying out different solutions, and "backtracking" when one reaches a dead-end.  
  Examples: N-Queens, Sudoku Solver, Subset Sum Problem.

- **Branch and Bound**  
  A general algorithm for finding optimal solutions to combinatorial problems by systematically exploring all possible solutions.  
  Examples: Traveling Salesman Problem, Integer Linear Programming.

- **Graph Algorithms**  
  Exploring various ways to represent and traverse graphs.  
  Examples: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s Algorithm, Prim’s Algorithm.
